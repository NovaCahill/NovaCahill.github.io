Hi, welcome to my page.
<br>
First, I am a very<a style="color:white;" href ="https://www.definitions.net/definition/humorous"> serious</a></style> person.
<br>
<br>This page contains and only contains some very basic info and serves as a glimpse into the real me.
<br>
<br>If you want to know more about me, talk with me.
<br>I mean, really, have a talk with me.
<br>I used the name Nova Cahill as the alias for my github page.
<br>This name comes from a character I wrote for some short stories.
<br>
<br>
<br>I am currently working on <a style="color:white;" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/">Category Theory</a></style> in terms of academic interest.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I studied <a style="color:white;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing">all three wepaons</a></style>at UCLA fencing team and am currently specialized in epee.
