This page is about some rather abstract aspects of myself.

<br>It is intended to represent my vision of the future, but actually, I am not even sure about my future at this point.

<br>So here we are. The gallery of this page contains some fun stuffs about me.
<br>Well, for the gallery, it looks like a Pullback. And it does.
<br>Have fun jumping back and forth!
