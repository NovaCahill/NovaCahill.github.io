Hi, welcome to my page.
<br>
First, I am a very<a style="color:white;" href ="https://www.definitions.net/definition/humorous"> serious</a></style> person.
<br>
<br>I am always reluctant to expose my personal infomation.
<br>So this page only contains some very basic info and serves as a glimpse into the real me.
<br>Well, if you want to know me, talk to me.
<br>I mean, really, talk to me. Be skeptical about what you see here.
<br>Afterall, fake news is everywhere around the internet now.
<br>Yes, <a style="color:white;" href ="https://www.masterworksfineart.com/artists/rene-magritte/lithograph/this-is-not-a-pipe/id/W-5560">Honestly</a></style>
<br>
<br>I learnt that eventually you all will know my name so I just reveal my real name here.
<br>My real name is Kaihan Yang. I used the name Nova Cahill (which sounds a bit like Kaihan) as the alias for my github page.
<br>The given name of this alias comes from different characters of few short stories I am writing.
<br>Yes, I enjoy writting short detective stories.
<br>I believe that you can deduce a lot about me from these pages. This is elementary.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>I am from <a style="color:white;" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantong>Nantong</a></style>, Jiangsu, China.
<br>I am a math-econ major here at UCLA from 2016.
<br>I spent one of my highschool years in Shanghai and three years in Wilbraham, MA.

<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>In terms of academic interest, I am currently interested in <a style="color:white;" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/">Category Theory</a></style>.
<br>I love arts, hiking, chess and cooking.
<br>I did rowing for three years, and I am currently doing fencing.
<br>
I studied <a style="color:white;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing">all three wepaons</a></style> here at UCLA fencing team and am currently specialized in epee.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is the symbol of fencing used in the Olympics.
