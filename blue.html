This page contains some fragments about my rowing days back to my high school years.
<br>I found this was an invaluable experience and thus it earned its own gallery.

Brief story
<br>
I did rowing during my high school years for my school's team at Wilbraham, Massachusetts.
<br>It was just a club when I initially joined in the year 2013, and our team eventually worked this club into a recognized varsity team a year later.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br><p style="color:white;">In 2016 the crew got the first quad scull of our own, the Queen of the Rubicon.</style>
<br>I was promoted into the coxswain of our scull for that spirng and our scull won a sliver medal at its debut regatta held by Narragansett Boat Club, Providence.

Background picture taken on Oct 26th, 2014,
I am not sure about the exact location.
I believe the picture is taken near the boathouse of Saratoga Rowing Association, after the regatta of the day.
